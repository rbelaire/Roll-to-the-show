# Roll to the Show — Product Requirements (v1)  ## One-line Pitch A fast, dice-driven baseball game where each roll determines outcomes, progression, and survival across seasons or a single rogue-like run.  ## Design Goals - Games should be completable in 5–10 minutes (Standard Season) - Rogue-like runs should complete in ~20–30 minutes - Randomness should feel exciting but not arbitrary - Players should understand outcomes without baseball expertise - All gameplay must be driven by dice tables and modifiers  ## Platforms - Mobile-first web application (React) - Desktop web supported but not optimized - No multiplayer in v1  ## Game Modes Overview The game includes two modes that share the same underlying gameplay engine: - Standard Season - Run to the Show (rogue-like)

## Standard Season Mode  ### Overview Standard Season is a straightforward, non-permadeath mode focused on quick, repeatable games and basic stat tracking. The player controls a single team across a fixed-length season against AI opponents.  ### Season Structure - Default season length: 20 games - Each game is played against an AI-controlled opponent - AI difficulty is fixed for v1 - No branching, events, or rogue-like modifiers are used in this mode  ### Game Rules - Default game length: 3 innings - Extra innings are NOT played in v1 - If the game is tied after the final inning, the result is recorded as a loss for the player  ### Progression and Persistence - The following stats are tracked across the season:   - Wins   - Losses   - Total runs scored   - Total runs allowed - Season data persists locally between sessions - The player may reset the season at any time via settings  ### Win/Loss Conditions - Win: Player has more runs than the opponent at game end - Loss: Player has fewer or equal runs than the opponent at game end  ### Explicit Non-Goals - No playoffs - No standings - No player trades or roster management - No difficulty scaling

## Run to the Show (Rogue-like Mode)  ### Overview Run to the Show is a run-based rogue-like mode where the player attempts to climb from the minor leagues to the major leagues in a single attempt. Failure at any tier immediately ends the run.  ### Run Structure - A run consists of sequential league tiers:   1. Single-A   2. Double-A   3. Triple-A   4. The Show - Each tier consists of a fixed number of games - The player begins each run in Single-A  ### Tier Requirements - Single-A:   - Games: 3   - Promotion: Win at least 2 games - Double-A:   - Games: 4   - Promotion: Win at least 3 games - Triple-A:   - Games: 5   - Promotion: Win at least 4 games - The Show:   - Games: 7   - Promotion: Win at least 4 games (best-of-7 championship)  ### Failure Rules - If the player fails to meet the promotion requirement at any tier:   - The run immediately ends   - The player is returned to the home screen   - Run results are recorded for meta-progression  ### Game Rules - Games follow the same inning and scoring rules as Standard Season - All active modifiers apply during games in this mode - No extra innings are played  ### Events - Between some games, the player is presented with an event - Each event presents exactly 2 choices - Each choice applies one or more modifiers - Events are defined via configuration, not hardcoded logic  ### Modifiers - Modifiers alter dice outcome probabilities - Modifiers may apply to:   - The current game   - The current tier   - The entire run - Multiple modifiers may be active simultaneously  ### Visibility - All active modifiers must be visible to the player during a run  ### Explicit Non-Goals - No branching map UI in v1 - No skipping tiers - No saving mid-run

## Core Gameplay Rules  ### Inning Structure - Games are divided into innings - Each inning consists of a top half (opponent bats) and a bottom half (player bats) - Each half-inning ends after 3 outs are recorded  ### Turn Flow 1. Current game state is displayed (inning, outs, runners, score) 2. Player initiates a dice roll 3. Dice are resolved into a single outcome 4. Outcome effects are applied to the game state 5. Commentary text is generated 6. Control returns to the player for the next roll  ### Dice Rolling - All gameplay outcomes are resolved via dice tables - Dice tables map probability distributions to discrete outcomes - Randomness must be injected via a seedable RNG - Dice resolution must be deterministic given the same inputs  ### Outcomes Possible outcomes include, but are not limited to: - Strikeout - Walk - Single - Double - Triple - Home Run - Error - Double Play  Outcomes must explicitly define: - Out changes - Base runner movement - Runs scored  ### Scoring - Runs score when a runner legally advances to home plate - Score updates immediately when runs are scored - No mercy rule exists in v1  ### Game End Conditions - A game ends after the final scheduled inning completes - If the player is tied or behind at game end, the result is a loss - No extra innings are played in v1

## Non-Functional Requirements  - The game must be playable on mid-range mobile devices - Dice animations and UI updates must feel responsive - Game state must persist locally between sessions - No network connection is required for gameplay  ## Explicit Out of Scope (v1)  - Multiplayer or online features - Cloud saves - Real MLB teams or licensing - Deep roster management - Trades, contracts, or injuries - Extra innings - Difficulty selection
